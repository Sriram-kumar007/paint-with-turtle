 This is an illustration of python module in tkinter.While running this

 file you can find a canvas where the turtle moves,some buttons and

 some entry boxes.you have to type the values in entry box and press 

 the button then you can see the turtle moving forward in the specified

 value in the entry box.For example, type '100'in the first entry box

 and press the button then you can find the turtle moving 100 pixels.

 The angle must be fed in right and left entry box and you can see the

 turtle turning.In the speed entry box you can use the values from 1 to

 10.You can change the shape of the turtle in shape entry box.From the
 
 options in menu bar you can use the tools(undo,home,clear,hide,show)
 
 for making your drawing better.drawing shapes in turtle is quiet tough

 to make it easy you can find some default polygons(square,circle 

 triangle,hexagon,pentagon).For any comments contact me
